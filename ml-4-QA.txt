1. The dataset used in this practical is downloaded from kaggle.

2. The used dataset contains 336 instances.

3. The used dataset contains 3 attributes with two numerical values i.e.,  x and y.

4. The used dataset used has attribute color represented by three number i.e, 0,1 and 2 which represents class.

5. K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters.

6. It is a centroid-based algorithm, where each cluster is associated with a centroid. The main aim of this algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between the data point and their corresponding clusters.
